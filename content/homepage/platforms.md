The simplest way to estimate biodiversity is to count the number of species that live within a defined area. This method almost certainly underestimates the number of species since many species move, may be unavailable to count at the time when surveys were conducted, or simply missed or potentially misidentified. As such, lots of data are needed to overcome known shortcomings associated with accurately counting species. For simplicity, we donâ€™t account for the potential of misidentified species or imperfect detection in this report. Instead, we used the 7,667,537 observations from 11,993 taxa submitted to various online platforms of species within Vermont by scientists, enthusiasts, and community scientists (GBIF.org downloaded 13 April 2022, https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.j53x2g). These occurrence records are the backbone of this report - without these species observations submitted by people across Vermont, this report would not have been possible.
