<!-- A partial to be overwritten by the user.
     Simply place a custom_head.html into
     your local /layouts/partials-directory.
     Its content will appear before the closing </head>-tag -->
<!-- Custom CSS via "custom.css"-file
     If you would rather place your custom CSS into
     a separate file, create a "custom.css" in your
     local "static/css"-directory. Then add a <link>-tag
     referencing your "custom.css" like so: -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href='{{ "css/custom.css" | absURL }}'>
